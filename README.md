# Cope-Evans Project

This repository contains materials for the Cope-Evans Project, a project by Haverford College Quaker & Special Collections and Digital Scholarship that explores the items in the Cope Evans Family Papers Collection (1683-2012). The papers include letters, financial documents, diaries, and shipping information. This project engages with the collection through prose and data visualization.
